# Setting up OpenCore and OpenRAN for 5G Simulation

Hi! In this repo I want to share how to setting 5G OpenCore using Open5Gs, OpenRAN using UERANSIM for 5G SA, and OpenRAN using srsRAN for 5G NSA. For remarks, I don't own these codes. I put all sources in this below:

[Building Open5GS from Sources | Open5GS](https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/02-building-open5gs-from-sources/)

[Katharina Kohls (kkohls.org)](https://kkohls.org/guides_open5gs.html)

[srsRAN](https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN)

## Application

You need to prepare:
- Virtualbox
- Linux Ubuntu version 18.04
- High Spec computer or server, so can handle three VMs with each of it has minimum 4Gb RAM & memory with 70 Gb.

## Documents & Guides 

You can download the document or open readme.md of each folder to read the full guide of each part. This repo contains several guides, there are:

- VM preparation
- VM configuration
- Open5Gs configuration for 5GC
- UERANSIM configuration
- 5G SA simulation
- Open5Gs configuration for EPC
- srsRAN configuration
- 5G NSA simulation
